# A statistical model of Victorian fire activity

Repository for code for building a statistical model of Victorian fire activity using boosted regression trees.

## Scripts

-   Step 1: Make analysis mask

-   Step 2: Generate annual burned area rasters

-   Step 3: Generate annual covariate rasters and save as stacks

-   Step 4: Extract the covariate and burned/unburned data for randomly sampled points

-   Step 5: Fit the boosted regression tree model

-   Step 6: Prepare covariate and model data for spatial and temporal cross validation with blockCV

-   Step 7: Do spatial and temporal cross validation (on Spartan)

-   Step 8: Summarise cross validation outputs

-   Step 9: Generate future climate prediction rasters

-   Step 10: Predict fire occurrence probabilities under alternative conditions

-   Step 11: Generate plots for publications
